           The tournament was originally scheduled to be held from August 18th to 23rd, 2020 in Avicii Arena in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve delayed the event to 2021 tentatively. Valve later announced that the event will take place on August 5th to 15th, 2021. However, due to issue with hosting the tournament in Sweden, Valve announced the tournament will take place from October 7th to 17th in Arena Națională in Bucharest, Romania.
